# Etch-a-Sketch

This project involves creating a web-based application that serves as a combination of a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It focuses on honing DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation skills. Users will be able to interact with a virtual drawing space in their browser, similar to sketching or doodling on a digital canvas. The project is designed for individuals looking to enhance their understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, particularly in the context of manipulating the Document Object Model to create interactive and dynamic web applications.
